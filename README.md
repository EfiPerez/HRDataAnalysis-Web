<p><u>About this project</u></p>
<p>In this Project, I will be covering my analysis and approach through different process flows in the data analysis pipeline.</p>
<p>The main goals are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe the company HR status with the help of some basic queries and visualizations.</li>
<li>Provide some insights on the weak points of the organization from HR perspective and provide some suggestions for solving the problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>The analysis reveals that fairness can be critical factor in the aspect of voluntary terminations. In addition, the effectiveness of recruiting agencies is relatively low and other sources such as employee referral and websites such as Glassdoor are found more effective than traditional sources.</p>
